Dear sir/medam,
I've complete performance test on frequently used API for test App.
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://www.banglapuzzle.com/

90 concurrent Request with 2 Loop count; Avg TPS for total samples is ~15 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1080.
100 concurrent Request with 2 Loop count; Avg TPS for total samples is ~13 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.
150 concurrent Request with 2 Loop count; Avg TPS for total samples is ~15.2 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1800.


While executed 150 concurrent request, found 75 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.1%.
Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 1500 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
Please find the details report from the attachment and let me know if you have any further queries.
